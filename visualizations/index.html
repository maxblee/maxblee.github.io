                                to hanging. Electrocution became a clear option; although the first death
                                from commercial electricity was not recorded until 1881, an average of 40 people died each year between 1883 and 1888.

                                Quickly, deaths by electrocution mounted, surpassing hangings as the predominant form of execution
                                by 1920.

                                some people proposed lethal gas as an execution method; Nevada became the first state to adopt
                                the practice in 1921. But gas never overtook electrocution as the dominant form of execution.

                                Especially in the North, juries were sentencing people to death less often than they had previously,
                                replacing death sentences with prison sentences.

                                was "cruel and unusual punishment" and violated the Eighth Amendment, cropped up as well. Finally,
                                in 1972, amid a broader decline in executions, the Supreme Court declared in a 5-4 ruling that
                                the death penalty was unconstitutional.

                                    States soon adopted various new sentencing schemes,
                                    hoping to get the Supreme Court to rule their adopted approaches Constitutional. 
                                    Just three years after the case was decided, 
                                    in 1975, 298 people were sentenced to death, the highest number for any year on record.
                                    And in the 1976 case <em>Gregg v. Georgia</em>,
                                    the Supreme Court affirmed sentencing schemes that gave juries
                                    some discretion in death penalty cases, causing executions to resume.

                This analysis of executions in the United States comes from two sources, the Epsy File of executions
                in the United States from 1608 to 2002 and the Death Penalty Information Center
                data on executions from 1976 to present. In both cases, the analysis is limited
                to executions occurring under state jurisdiction and excludes executions
                occurring under local jurisdictions and federal jurisdiction. Prior to the 1940s, executions
                under local jurisdictions were common, comprising <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XK7Bb-ars74C&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=Negley+K.+Teeters+and+Charles+J.+Zibulka+execution&source=bl&ots=WyLM8utD8u&sig=ACfU3U1tAuuPQpCKbQ6wFM5oVqLLpkfzug&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0_Zz9itLlAhUTs54KHRnTDNcQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=Negley%20K.%20Teeters%20and%20Charles%20J.%20Zibulka%20execution&f=false">
                three-quarters of all executions prior to 1945.</a> However, the Epsy data from local jurisdictions
                comes from newspaper accounts and other disparate sources and is known to be an incomplete source
                of local capital punishment data. The state data, however, is mostly complete.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="notes">The Epsy data is also less complete during earlier years. I focused
                particularly on data from 1864 to present because of work Negley K. Teeters and Charles J. Zibulka
                conducted that recorded state executions from 1864 to 1967. Epsy confirmed all of the findings
                from Teeters and Zibulka, meaning that all of the data reported until 2002 should have been checked
                by at least two separate sources, making the overall data recorded fairly robust and complete.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="notes">
                Finally, there were some disagreements between the Epsy data and the data from the Death Penalty Information Center.
                For every year in which the number of executions reported by Epsy differed from the Death Penalty Information
                Center figures, the Death Penalty Information Center numbers were greater.
                This suggests that the data from the Death Penalty Information Center is slightly more complete than the Epsy data.
                Therefore, I chose to use the Death Penalty Information Center data from 1976 - 2018, excluding
                2019 data from the Death Penalty Information Center and all of the Epsy data occurring on or after 1976.
