			is a tool I built to create pivot tables from the command-line. It's designed
			to work nicely with other command-line tools like
			<pre class="inline-highlight"><code>xsv</code></pre>.
			</p>
			<p>If you want to get started using the tool,
				visit the <a href="https://github.com/maxblee/clipivot">GitHub repository.</a>
				That page has all of the usage documentation along with pre-compiled
				binaries.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I also wanted to demonstrate what the tool does. So this web page
				allows you to configure settings for your pivot table. You can
				see the command you'd have to run,
				you can see the output you'd expect to get as an HTML table, and you can download
				the actual CSV file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this is primarily a tool to display the workings of
				clipivot. Its
				performance is quite poor, and you are likely to run into memory issues
				if you try to run especially large files on it.
